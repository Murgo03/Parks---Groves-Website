        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="section">Parks & Groves is a South Jersey based band. Matt(lead singer) and Justin (drummer) met in church back in 2013. 
                            Soon after they started their first band together called faith beyond fear; playing every and any show they could get themselves into. 
                            A year later they met Ryan(guitarist) who then also joined their band briefly as the bass player and moving to guitar shortly after.
                             Over the next three years the band changed names to Above the Fall and then Silent culture. 
                             Over those years they opened up for artist like Colton Dixon,NF,We are Messangers just to name a few. 
                             Traveled the east coast once again playing every and any show they could.
                              From songs on the radio,to music videos,and opening up for some of their favorite artist they got to experience every door God opened. 
                              In 2020 that chapter of their lives closed and all the guys went on to chase everything else life had to offer. 
                              Four years later with more life lived and more stories to tell Matt,Justin, and Ryan came back together to find their sound and tell their stories. 
                             The good,the bad,the struggles, and the blessings. </div>
